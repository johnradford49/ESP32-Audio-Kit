ESP32-Audio-Kit is a small audio development board based on ESP32-A1S module. Most audio peripherals are distributed on both sides of the development board, supporting TF card, headphone output, two microphone inputs and two speaker outputs. It is convenient for developers to develop quickly. Suitable for home smart devices, smart speaker solutions, children's story machine prototypes, etc., is an ideal solution for IoT applications.
